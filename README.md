Really, This is very good plugin for any WordPress website on the basis of below 2 factors.
* i) Non WordPress developer can easily manage website sidebars by this plugin.
* ii) If we have a WordPress website and suppose we are using 20 sidebars in complete website then we have to write more than 50 lines codes in activated theme functions.php file. But, If we are using this plugin then we don't need to write any code for registering sidebars. We can manage all by WordPress back end.
